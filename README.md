AutoArch is a way to automatically install Archlinux on a localhost.
I was tired to reinstall Archlnux and worried to lose my config, so AutoArch was created.

The process is done using Ansible.
It was a way for me to learn about general automation.

This work was inspired by the https://github.com/sugarraysam/archsugar, I suggest you go see his work before mine!

Roadmap:
make a python wrapper around ansible to it is easier to use.

  name: Transfering repo to {{ user }} home
  copy:
      dest: "/home/{{ user }}" # required. Remote absolute path where the file should be copied to. If I(src) is a directory, this must be a directory too. If I(dest) is a nonexistent path and if either I(dest) ends with "/" or I(src) is a directory, I(dest) is created. If I(src) and I(dest) are files, the parent directory of I(dest) isn't created: the task fails if it doesn't already exist.
      src: /root/archauto # not required. Local path to a file to copy to the remote server; can be absolute or relative. If path is a directory, it is copied recursively. In this case, if path ends with "/", only inside contents of that directory are copied to destination. Otherwise, if it does not end with "/", the directory itself with all contents is copied. This behavior is similar to Rsync.
      directory_mode: true # not required. When doing a recursive copy set the mode for the directories. If this is not set we will use the system defaults. The mode is only set on directories which are newly created, and will not affect those that already existed
      group: "{{ user }}"
      owner: "{{ user }}" # not required. Name of the user that should own the file/directory, as would be fed to I(chown).
